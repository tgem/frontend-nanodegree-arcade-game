**Running the game**

Simply download or clone the repository to your local machine and open index.html to start the game.

**Playing the game**

- Your objective is to move the player character safely across the road to the water. The game is won, and restarts, once you have reached the water.
- If you collide with any of the bugs running across the street, your attempt has failed and the game restarts.
- Use the left, up, right and down keys on the keyboard to move the player character. Note that your character always moves a full board piece with each klick, and that it cannot move off the screen.
